# [Project 1: Sales Metrics Visualization With Power BI](https://github.com/PowerBI/MavenMarket.pbix)
In this project I looked at the sales of 100+ stores scaterred throughout multiple continents to detemine the total revenue per product, along with monthly KPI to determine business preformance. Power Query and DAX language was used to create the necessary metrics for the visualization, also helping cleaning up the data, and estabishing clear relationships between tables.
