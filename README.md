# [Project 1: Sales Metrics Visualization With Power BI](https://github.com/marioreyes5/Mario_Portfolio/blob/main/PowerBI/MavenMarket.pbix)
In this project I looked at the sales of 100+ stores scaterred throughout multiple continents to detemine the total revenue per product, along with monthly KPI to determine business preformance. Power Query and DAX language was used to create the necessary metrics for the visualization, also helping cleaning up the data, and estabishing clear relationships between tables.

# [Project 2: Nationwide Covid-19 Statistics](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mario.reyes5171/viz/NationwideCovid-19Statisticsasof2113/Dashboard1?publish=yes)
A Covid-19 nationwide analysis on continents and their countries. Data was outsoured from the [OurWorldinData](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) website which compiled population, infection, vaccination, and death information from February 4, 2020 to January 31, 2023. 

SQL queries were written to explore the information in the data sets. Once the analysis was completed, the most interesting findings were exported to excel sheets to upload into Tableau. Metric visualization were created using Tableau Desktop, grouped together in a dashboard, and uploaded to Tableau Public.
