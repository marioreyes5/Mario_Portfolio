# [Project 1: Sales Metrics Visualization With Power BI](https://github.com/marioreyes5/Mario_Portfolio/blob/main/PowerBI/MavenMarket.pbix)
In this project I looked at the sales of 100+ stores scattered throughout multiple continents to determine the total revenue per product, along with monthly KPI to determine business performance. Power Query and DAX language was used to create the necessary metrics for the visualization, also helping to clean up the data, and establishing clear relationships between tables.

# [Project 2: Nationwide Covid-19 Statistics](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mario.reyes5171/viz/NationwideCovid-19Statisticsasof2113/Dashboard1?publish=yes)
A Covid-19 nationwide analysis on continents and their countries. Data was outsoured from the [OurWorldinData](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) website which compiled population, infection, vaccination, and death information from February 4, 2020 to January 31, 2023. 

[SQL queries](https://github.com/marioreyes5/Mario_Portfolio/blob/main/Covid19_SQLQuery.sql) were written to explore the information in the data sets. Once the analysis was completed, the most compelling findings were identified and exported to excel sheets to upload into Tableau. Metric visualizations were created using Tableau Desktop, grouped together in a dashboard, and uploaded to Tableau Public

# [Project 3: StockX Sales Data](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mario.reyes5171/viz/NationwideCovid-19Statisticsasof2113/Dashboard1?publish=yes)
In 2019 StockX, an online retailer platform, hosted a data contest giving people the opportunity to use current sales data to identify trends in the market. [The StockX Contest] supplied us with a snippet of shoe sales from between 9/1/2017 to 2/13/2019 consisting of US sales. 

The data was imported into SQL for clean up, modification, and analysis. Then, data from the queries was exported to cvs files and linked to tableau desktop. Visualization building took place in tableau desktop and finally uploaded to tableau public.
